# minecraft
A mini Minecraft-inspired 3D game developed in Python using the Ursina engine. This project served as the final assignment for Python 3D Game Development course, which I designed and teach at Geeklama.

The game demonstrates core concepts of 3D game development, including world generation, block placement/removal, camera control, and player interaction in a real-time environment.
